--- if you cannot understand something or is feeling confused about something
    try to learn the basics and try to learn it again and again until you
    understand the basics and remember it. ---

--- the course you take may not be used immediately in a typical way but may be
    used after a period of time.A course said to be in an intermediate level
    may not feel to be that exciting because may be your expectation of thrill
    that you want may be high.one important thing is that you may feel something
    as low or not as good during the course but you have to try to kind of continue
    the course and complete it. typical high comes from "idea" ---

--- may be simple things are difficult because may be they may not have multiple
    methods of doing it or typically multiple solutions to the question ---

--- may be mind is like a train, when it is going fast it may not be able to
    take new passengers. To take a new passenger the train has to slow down
    or normally it has to stop. after getting a passenger it may have to
    accelerate to move at a high steady speed ---

--- you may not get typical thrill in hacking always. it may be like day and night,
    you may know  the value of thrill if it is absent for a period of time.
    and waiting for the next round of thrill is a diffrent kind of a thrill.
    so do not stop travelling in the night because if you die in the night
    you will not live to see the next day --- 
 


--- may be the most stable state a man can be is in the state of play ---

--- may be you should learn one thing in different ways.
    may be you should do software build of debian packages and learn
    to write tests using expect for another simple code and put it on github ---

--- may be learn to write testcases using one code related and learn to
    file bug reports using debian logs and other and learn programming using
    python by writing code for another software ---


--- may be you should only report bugs and do testing in debian and do not
    try to fix the code if it is there because if you try to do everything
    you may not be a part of a team typically. so just test and report bugs.
    fixing things in code may be done in your own project like dollect---

--- may be do not take the responsibility of testing the whole of kernel.
    may be try to choose an area in linux such as "tools/testing/selftest"
    part.Now do not think that you will report all the problems in this area.
    give that chance for others.even if its is your area . do not try to do
    every thing in that. ---

--- now in debian do not try to report every thing you see in syslog.leave
    things for others. even do not report and test every bug related you
    find in debian. leave it for others  ---
