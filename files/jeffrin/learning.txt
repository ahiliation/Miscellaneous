IN LEARNING PROCESS 

--- clue to a solution to a problem may be somewhere near the problem ---
--- for a continous learning, you may have to come back to a topic you
    learned to discover new things or understand something what you could
    not fully understand ---

--- as you progress you may have to think in abstractions and practice may bring clarity ---

--- may be you have to accept the ways of the teacher for your learning process atleast temporarily ---
