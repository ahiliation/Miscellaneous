using google drive to backup for beautifulwork.org
--------------------------------------------------

A good alternative might be drive which is written in go and has quite a lot features.

To install follow these instructions:

Install needed packages

sudo apt-get install golang git mercurial
Create a path for go packages in your home directory

mkdir $HOME/go $HOME/go/bin
Add these paths to the appropriate environment variables by editing the file .profile in your home directory. So add these lines at the and of that file:

if [ -d "$HOME/go" ] ; then
    export GOPATH="$HOME/go"
    fi

if [ -d "$HOME/go/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
    fi
    Log off and log on to let the changes take effect.

Download and install drive from latest source

go get -u github.com/odeke-em/drive/cmd/drive
Read https://github.com/odeke-em/drive/#usage

Basic usage:

drive init <folder> initializes <folder> for syncing with your Google Drive.
If yo do drive pull in your initialized folder, it will download all changes from Google Drive. At the first time maybe you have to do this more times to download everything.
drive push uploads local changes.
drive pull <fileOrPath> or drive push <fileOrPath> does the corresponding action only for <fileOrPath>.
There are many more options to use, so read the manual.
