I do not like hard and fast rules for my work time.
I like to do upstream work.
I like to play.
I like to do one domain of work.
I like to obey upstream.
I like to have a final acceptence of work by me.
I believe in "one thing at a time"
I like all play.
I do not like to limit my work for just one
organization.
Should work with conflict resolution when working on
different projects.
I do not like to repeat the same work  once
knowledge is acquired.
I like thrill.
I like to repeat the work even after a typical level
of knowledge is acquired, only if it is helping or is
being used by other people.
more knowledge may be acquired by repeating the work.
(we may have knowledge to do it faster )
