<P><FONT SIZE="+2">In 1991, a joint report of the
<SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JavaScript><!--
           ShowURL("Association of Computing Machinery", "http://www.acm.org")
        // --></SCRIPT> and the <SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JavaScript><!--
           ShowURL("IEEE Computer Society", "http://www.computer.org")
        // --></SCRIPT> defined seven "Core areas of computer
science."  Since that time, <SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JavaScript><!--
           ShowURL("Computing Sciences Accreditation Board", "http://www.csab.org")
        // --></SCRIPT> has identified two other areas
(<I>computer graphics</I> and <I>computer networks</I>) as separate
areas (originally contained in <I>human-computer interaction</I> and
<I>operating systems</I>, respectively).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+2">The nine subject areas defining the core of computer
science are:</FONT></P>

<DL>
   <DT><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Algorithms and Data
   Structures</B></FONT></P></DT>
   
   <DD><FONT SIZE="+2">This area deals with specific classes of
   problems and their efficient solutions. The performance
   characteristics of algorithms and the organization of data
   relative to different access requirements are major
   components.</FONT></DD>
   
   <DT><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Architecture</B></FONT></P></DT>
   
   <DD><FONT SIZE="+2">Methods of organizing efficient, reliable
   computing systems provide a central focus of this area. It
   includes implementation of processors, memory, communications, and
   software interfaces, as well as the design and control of large
   computational systems that are reliable.</FONT></DD>
   
   <DT><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Artificial Intelligence and
   Robotics</B></FONT></P></DT>
   
   <DD><FONT SIZE="+2">The basic models of behavior and the building
   of (virtual or actual) machines to simulate animal and human
   behavior are included here. Inference, deduction, pattern
   recognition, and knowledge representation are major
   components.</FONT></DD>
   
   <DT><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Database and Information
   Retrieval</B></FONT></P></DT>
   
   <DD><FONT SIZE="+2">The area is concerned with the organization of
   information and algorithms for the efficent access and update of
   stored information. The modeling of data relationships, security
   and protection of information in a shared environment, and the
   characteristics of external storage devices are included in this
   area.</FONT></DD>
   
   <DT><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Human-Computer
   Communication</B></FONT></P></DT>
   
   <DD><FONT SIZE="+2">The efficient transfer of information between
   humans and machines is the central focus of this area. Graphics,
   human factors that affect efficient interaction, and the
   organization and display of information for effective utilization
   by humans are included.</FONT></DD>
   
   <DT><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Numerical and Symbolic
   Computation</B></FONT></P></DT>
   
   <DD><FONT SIZE="+2">General methods for efficiently and accurately
   using computers to solve equations from mathematical models are
   central to this area. The effectiveness and efficiency of various
   approaches to the solution of equations, and the development of
   high-quality mathematical software packages are important
   components.</FONT></DD>
   
   <DT><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Operating Systems</B></FONT></P></DT>
   
   <DD><FONT SIZE="+2">This area deals with control mechanisms that
   allow multiple resources to be efficiently coordinated during the
   execution of programs. Included are appropriate services of user
   requests, effective strategies for resource control, and effective
   organization to support distributed computation.</FONT></DD>
   
   <DT><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Programming Languages</B></FONT></P></DT>
   
   <DD><FONT SIZE="+2">The fundamental questions addressed by this
   area involve notations for defining virtual machines that execute
   algorithms, the efficient translation from high-level languages to
   machine codes, and the various extension mechanisms that can be
   provided in programming languages.</FONT></DD>
   
   <DT><P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Software Methodology and
   Engineering</B></FONT></P></DT>
   
   <DD><FONT SIZE="+2">The major focus of this area is the
   specification, design, and production of large software systems.
   Principles of programming and software development, verification
   and validation of software, and the specification and production
   of software systems that are safe, secure, reliable, and
   dependable are of special interest.</FONT></DD>
