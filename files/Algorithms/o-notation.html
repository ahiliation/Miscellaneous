		<h1>A Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Big O Notation</h1>
		
		<p>Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the <strong>worst-case</strong> scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.<span id="more-200"></span></p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s read Programming Pearls or any other Computer Science books and doesn&#8217;t have a grounding in Mathematics will have hit a wall when they reached chapters that mention O(N log N) or other seemingly crazy syntax. Hopefully this article will help you gain an understanding of the basics of Big O and Logarithms.</p>
<p>As a programmer first and a mathematician second (or maybe third or fourth) I found the best way to understand Big O thoroughly was to produce some examples in code. So, below are some common orders of growth along with descriptions and examples where possible.</p>
<h3>O(1)</h3>
<p>O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.</p>
<pre>bool IsFirstElementNull(String[] strings)
{
	if(strings[0] == null)
	{
		return true;
	}
	return false;
}</pre>
<h3>O(N)</h3>
<p>O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. The example below also demonstrates how Big O favours the worst-case performance scenario; a matching string could be found during any iteration of the <code>for</code> loop and the function would return early, but Big O notation will always assume the upper limit where the algorithm will perform the maximum number of iterations.</p>
<pre>bool ContainsValue(String[] strings, String value)
{
	for(int i = 0; i &lt; strings.Length; i++)
	{
		if(strings[i] == value)
		{
			return true;
		}
	}
	return false;
}</pre>
<h3>O(N<sup>2</sup>)</h3>
<p>O(N<sup>2</sup>) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N<sup>3</sup>), O(N<sup>4</sup>) etc.</p>
<pre>bool ContainsDuplicates(String[] strings)
{
	for(int i = 0; i &lt; strings.Length; i++)
	{
		for(int j = 0; j &lt; strings.Length; j++)
		{
			if(i == j) // Don't compare with self
			{
				continue;
			}

			if(strings[i] == strings[j])
			{
				return true;
			}
		}
	}
	return false;
}</pre>
<h3>O(2<sup>N</sup>)</h3>
<p>O(2<sup>N</sup>) denotes an algorithm whose growth will double with each additional element in the input data set. The execution time of an O(2<sup>N</sup>) function will quickly become very large.</p>
<h3>Logarithms</h3>
<p>Logarithms are slightly trickier to explain so I&#8217;ll use a common example:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search" target="_blank">Binary search</a> is a technique used to search sorted data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the median, and compares it against a target value. If the values match it will return success. If the target value is higher than the value of the probe element it will take the upper half of the data set and perform the same operation against it. Likewise, if the target value is lower than the value of the probe element it will perform the operation against the lower half. It will continue to halve the data set with each iteration until the value has been found or until it can no longer split the data set.</p>
<p>This type of algorithm is described as <strong>O(log N)</strong>. The iterative halving of data sets described in the binary search example produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase e.g. an input data set containing 10 items takes one second to complete, a data set containing 100 items takes two seconds, and a data set containing 1000 items will take three seconds. Doubling the size of the input data set has little effect on its growth as after a single iteration of the algorithm the data set will be halved and therefore on a par with an input data set half the size. This makes algorithms like binary search extremely efficient when dealing with large data sets.</p>

				<p>When my programming professor went over this during our intro to programming class, that&#8217;s about all she said about the subject. Seeing O(logN) looks scary if you don&#8217;t know what it means, but it isn&#8217;t really that difficult a concept to pick up.</p>

				<p>Nice article, but I&#8217;ll have to quibble with this: &#8220;Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario.&#8221;<br />
That is not the case. Big-O notation just describes asymptotic bounds, so it is correct to say something like, for example, &#8220;Quicksort is in O(n!),&#8221; even though Quicksort&#8217;s actual worst-case running time will never exceed O(n^2). All Big-O is saying is &#8220;for an input of size n, there is a value of n after which quicksort will always take less than n! steps to complete.&#8221; It does not say &#8220;Quicksort will take n! steps in the worst case.&#8221;</p>

				<p>Very well put. It&#8217;s a shame people concern themselves more with design patterns and domain models while not giving a bit of attention to the core of all programming and where most of its concepts and methods are born, mathematical logic. Of course they all play an equal role in development but none should never be forgotten as often as the mathematical logic is.</p>

				<p>Nice explanation. Might be nice to have some info on &#8220;Big Theta&#8221; and &#8220;Omega&#8221; running times, and perhaps on space-complexity. But that&#8217;s for another post I suppose&#8230;</p>
<p>@Al K.: From a practical perspective of big O notation, the description in this blog post is correct. One could say that Quicksort is O(n!), the phrase meets the definition of an asymptotic bound, but that would go against a generally accepted idea that Big O complexity is the best-possible, worst case running time. In most programming contexts, the best possible, worst case order of the algorithm is given, because this is what most (the ones who aren&#8217;t into theory as much) programmers worry about when they code solutions to problems. I guess there is context I could see for giving a higher-than-best, worst case time complexity is for categorizing algorithms, or for theoretical proofs of another algorithm, but I don&#8217;t come across it very often <img src='http://rob-bell.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> .</p>

				<p>@bluehavana &#8220;O(log N) is log base 2 as well. This is an important distinction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding O notation there is no distinction between O(log N), O(ln N) or logarithms of any base. This is because O notation is saying, asymptotically, that the algorithm has a time complexity limited by the log function. A logarithm of any base b is a real multiple of any generic logarithm: log_b N = log N / log b. These are equivalent in O notation because of its definition:<br />
&#8220;if g(x) is O(f(x)) there exists some real constant M such that g(x) &lt;= M f(x)&#8221;<br />
obviously if we multiply by 1/log b, there is another real constant N = M / log b that satisfies this definition.</p>
<p>Anyway nice article Rob, hopefully I&#8217;ll be joining you for a few lunches up in London soon.</p>
