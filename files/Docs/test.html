Trueprint is a printing program for postscript printers that
is designed to be the only printing program you'll need.
Originally written while I(Lezz Giles) was at AT&T, it was expanded and
improved during my time at Motorola and Digital, and now it
has been accepted as a GNU package. Interestingly, the
original version was developed and enhanced independently by Mark Skeates at AT&T/Lucent and is now part of their
exptools package. The GNU version has diverged so much that they no longer share any source. </p>
<p>Trueprint has been ported to the Mac by Gene Tucciarone - I've lost
track of Gene and I can't find a homepage for either him or the Mac
version, but if you search using Google you'll find packages. </p>

The best way to find out about trueprint's features is
to download it and read the documentation. New features have been
added as needed continuously for well over a decade, so there are
options to control just about any aspect of the output:
<ul>
<li> It'll print single or double sided,</li>
<li> It'll format a dozen languages appropriately with comments
in italics and function names in bold, with function and file indices,</li>
<li> It'll print one-, two- or four-up,</li>
<li> It prints on as much of the page as possible, and uses a
special file to understand the printable space on each page.</li>
<li> It'll print differences between old and new versions of
files,</li>
<li> It can print out just selected pages,</li>
<li> All headers and footers are customizable.</li>
<li> It can leave space for holepunches down the side of the
sheet or at the top of the sheet,</li>
<li> You can select the font size and leading size</li>
<li> And so on. There are almost fifty options in total.</li>
</ul>
And if trueprint doesn't do what you want it to, you can modify
the source code to add your own features.
<hr width="100%">Trueprint evolved using standard single-letter options
up to version 4.1.2., the last non-GNU version.
<p>GNU trueprint was an almost complete rewrite of trueprint. The
major changes were the change to GNU-standard long options in addition to
the short options, and the addition of GNU standard documentation.
Unfortunately there was no practical way to keep all the original single-letter
options with the same meanings, so the interface changed incompatibly from
version 4 to the GNU version. </p>
<p>Trueprint version 5.0 was the first GNU version, but it had several major
problems. In particular you needed to have the correct libraries and
header files in order to compile it, which meant that you either had to use
a Linux system or you needed to copy a few key header and source files from
a standard distribution. </p>
<p>Trueprint version 5.1 was the second GNU version, but it also had more
than its fair share of bugs, including an error in the printers file that
could cause a coredump. </p>
<p>Trueprint 5.2 was the next GNU version. It fixes all known bugs
and can be compiled on just about any platform, including Microsoft platforms,
with GCC.</p>
<p>Trueprint 5.3 was when I started playing with autoconf and automake. The
first couple of versions had problems; the latest should be OK. </p>
<hr width="100%">
<p>There are a few known problems with Trueprint. The most common
problems are really problems with the languages that people expect trueprint
to be able to format. In particular C is very problematical.
Because C uses a preprocessor it is not always possible to properly parse
a C source file, and so trueprint can easily become confused. <br>
Similar problems apply to Perl - the simple parser built in to trueprint
cannot properly manage all Perl programs either. If you feel like
improving the way that trueprint manages these languages (or any other)
all you need to do is write better versions of lang_c.c, lang_perl.c, or
any other language files.
