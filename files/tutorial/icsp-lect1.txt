-- knowledge = declarative knowledge  + imperative knowledge -- 

-- imperative knowledge = HOWTO knowledge --

-- there can be a circuit to find the square root of a value --

-- there can be a circuit which accepts the input as a circuit
   and make the circuit work like the input circuit --

-- stored program computer = will have a sequence of instruction 
   to process --

-- stored program computer = memory + CPU + ALU + Program Counter --

-- program counter points to the first instruction in memory and
   after it is executed it moves to the second instruction and so
   on... --

-- given a fixed set of primitives , a programmer can program 
   anything --

-- a typical primitive example = anything that is done using c
   can also be done in fortran --

-- description to primitives needs a programming language --

-- there is no such thing as best language --

-- dimensions of a language :
 1. high level or low level language
 2. general or a targetted language
 3. interpreted or compiled language

--

-- syntax says = what are the legal expressions --

-- static semantic says = which programs are meaningful --
-- full semantics say = what is going to happen when i run 
   a program --
