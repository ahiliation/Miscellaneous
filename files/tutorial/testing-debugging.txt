-- Testing and Debugging --

- Validation is a process designed to uncover problems and
  increase confidence about what our programs does we think 
  it intented to do. -

 
- Testing and Reasoning -

- Debugging is a process of ascertaining why the program is
  not working. -

- Unit testing = validate each piece of the program independently. -
- Integration testing = validate if the overall program works  -

- Test Suite = small enough so that we can test it in a reasonable
  amount of time and large enough so that we can have some confidence -

- Debugging is a process of engineering -

- Goal of debugging is  not to eliminate 1 bug , but to have a bug-free
  program -

- Two best debugging tools are print statement and  reading -

- knowing to debug the code is the single most important skill to 
  debuggging. -

- be systematic in debugging -

- debugging is simply a search process -

- scientific method of debugging = study available data + Test results + 
  program text(As you study the program text keep in mind that you do not 
  understand it, cause if you really did you may not have the bug) + Form
  a hypothesis with all the data + design and run a repeatable experiment -

- a valid scientific experiment should have the potential to refute 
  hypothesis - 

- design an experiment = find the simplest input that will provoke the bug
  + find the part of the program that is probably at fault(use binary 
  search method) -
