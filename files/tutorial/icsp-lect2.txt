-- To write programs we need: some representation of fundamental data
   + a way to give instructions to computer to manipulate that data. --


-- primitive data = numbers + strings + boolean --

-- expression = operand + operator --

-- interpreter evaluates and prints --

-- inside a script there is no print unless we make it explicit --

-- type discipline --

-- when you work on a program you need to know about the type 
   discipline (type of the value) to pass arguments --

-- operator precedence --

-- statements = legal commands that python can interpret --

-- comments = words to reader of the code to understand what
   is going inside that code --

-- straight line program = a program where we execute a 
   sequence of instructions one by one --

-- branching programs = a program that can change the order of
   instructions based on some test and that test is usually a
   value of a variable --

-- iteration - loops --

-- iteration = executing multiple statements based on a test --
