What is an Armstrong number ?

A number is called Armstrong number if the sum of the cube
of each digit of that number is equals to the number itself.

Example:
153  = 1 + 5^3 + 3^3  So, 153 is Armstrong Number.
142 != 1 + 4^3 + 2^3  So, 142 is Not an Armstrong Number.

Problem Statement: 

Design an algorithm to find a given number N is Armstrong number or not.
